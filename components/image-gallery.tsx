The cutout is decorated with a beautiful, vibrant flower garland draped gracefully around the neck and shoulders, adding a festive and respectful touch. Place the cutout on a sturdy support frame in a busy public square filled with a diverse crowd of enthusiastic fans facing and admiring it. Fans are cheering, holding flags, banners, and placards with the personâ€™s image, some capturing the moment on their phones. The fans look up in awe, creating a natural, dynamic interaction. Add scattered fresh flower petals on the ground, colorful confetti floating gently in the air, and warm sunlight casting soft shadows over the scene. The environment should feel lively and celebratory, with realistic urban elements like buildings, trees, and street lamps framing the background",

The statue stands tall in the middle of a roundabout in Dhaka, near a famous historical landmark. The statue is still under construction, surrounded by scaffolding, with many construction workers in yellow helmets and orange vests climbing, welding, and working on it. Parts of the statue's body are still exposed metal framework, while other sections are already detailed and finished. The background shows the realistic atmosphere of Dhaka city: crowded streets with colorful rickshaws, packed buses, and small cars circling the roundabout. Street vendors with tea stalls, fruit carts, and colorful umbrellas line the roadside. Shop signs, big billboards, and messy hanging electric wires crisscross above the streets, creating the typical Dhaka city vibe. The bright daytime sky shines above, with tropical trees and a bustling, lively atmosphere. Style: photorealistic, vibrant, and full of life",
